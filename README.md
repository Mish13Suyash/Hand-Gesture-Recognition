# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

Hand gesture recognition using deep learning can be accomplished by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of hand gesture images. Here, we will walk through the process of setting up a model, training it, and evaluating its performance using TensorFlow and Keras. This will include loading the dataset, applying data augmentation, defining the model architecture, and using callbacks like EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint, and ReduceLROnPlateau

The Dataset, *Hand Gesture Recognition Database*, for this project is available on kaggle
